		<a>The paragraph above is one of the most popular placeholders of all time. We at the placeholder market strive to sell even more unique and awe-inspiring place holders such as:</a>
		<br><br>
		<a>I like to act like a goblin. I don't know why but I just enjoy doing this. Maybe it's my way of dealing with stress or something but I just do it about once every week. Generally I'll carry around a sack and creep around in a sort of crouch-walking position making goblin noises, then I'll walk around my house and pick up various different “trinkets” and put them in my bag while saying stuff like “I'll be having that” and laughing maniacally in my goblin voice (“trinkets” can include anything from stuff I find on the ground to cutlery or other utensils). The other day I was talking with my neighbours and they mentioned hearing weird noises like what I wrote about and I was just internally screaming the entire conversation. I'm 99% sure they don't know it's me but god that 1% chance is seriously weighing on my mind.</a>

		<a>Another great placeholder created by one of the avid memebers of the Placeholder market is thus:</a>
		<br><br>
		<a>Why is six afraid of seven? Six hasn't been the same since he left Vietnam. He can seldom close his eyes without opening them again at fear of Charlies lurking in the jungle trees. Not that you could ever see the bastards, mind you. They were swift, and they knew their way around the jungle like nothing else. He remembers the looks on the boys' faces as he walked into that village and... oh, Jesus. The memories seldom left him, either. Sometimes he'd reminisce - even hear - Tex's southern drawl. He remembers the smell of Brooklyn's cigarettes like nothing else. He always kept a pack of Lucky's with him. The boys are gone, now. He knows that; it's just that he forgets, sometimes. And, every now and then, the way that seven looks at him with avid concern in his eyes... it makes him think. Sets him on edge. Makes him feel like he's back there... in the jungle.</a>

		<a>every single placeholder in this market strives to have as much quality as the ones presented above, and we will continually work to produce more and more.</a>
